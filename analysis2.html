                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p> This is a stop motion project from IAT 313. I was in charge of filming and editing the video, and I used Premiere Pro to edit the short film. At first, we were brainstorming on the concept we wanted to focus on. Since the projectâ€™s date is in the month of Halloween, we think that it would be a good idea to film a Halloween related film, therefore, we came up with this film. It is about a skeleton entering an audition to become a superstar. My partner and I made the background and props and we filmed for 3 days. It was a tough time because we had to take a lot of pictures and make them into a video. During the editing process, some of the images are too dark, and I colour graded the images to make the film more lively. I combined the film and looked for the sound effect for the characters. It took me a while to find the sound effects because it is hard to find an effect that is related to a figurine. Although the film is not long, it teaches me how to deliver the film message to the audience within a short amount of time. Also, it teaches me how to edit still images using different fps.
