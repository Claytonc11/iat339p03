                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p> This is a highlight reel of the production company I am working in. The highlight reel recaps what the company did in 2018. I was in charge of editing this video, and I used Final Cut Pro X to complete this project. In this project, I selected the clips from various completed projects, such as wedding highlights, music videos, and our competition film. In the beginning, I have to select the b-rolls that are suitable for the intro scene. Then, I picked some scenes that are shooting in different shot sizes. After I combine all the clips, I have to add Luts to all the videos to make it more appealing. I also add some sound effects to make the scene more natural. At 20 seconds, and 50 seconds I added crowded sound effects and adjusted the volume for different scenes to blend it with the background music. In the end, I applied snow VFX to match with the last snowing scene to the end scene. I was a beginner when I was editing this video, and it is a memorable experience for me. I learned a lot of editing techniques from editing this video. I learned how to match the clips with the music video seamlessly, choose suitable footage for highlight videos, and combine non-diegetic sounds with the clips. </p>
