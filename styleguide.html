                    <h3>Bio</h3>
                    <p>Hi I am Clayton Cheung, and I am a third year IAT student in SFU. I am interested in video editing and UX design. I have learned editing for two years, and I would like to create videos that are related to media and technology. I am a minimalist on designing and editing, therefore, I created a black and white theme website that can symbolize video as well. This portfolio is my first step to showcase my work to the audiences.

                    <h3>Analysis #1</h3>
                    <p> This is a highlight reel of the production company I am working in. The highlight reel recaps what the company did in 2018. I was incharge of editing this video, and I used Final Cut Pro X to complete this project. In this project, I selected the clips from various completed projects, such as wedding highlights, music videos and our competition film. At the beginning, I have to select the b-rolls that are suitable for the intro scene. Then, I picked some scenes that are shooting in different shot sizes. After I combine all the clips, I have to add luts to all the video to make it more appealing. I also add some sound effects to make the scene more natural. At 20 seconds, and 50 seconds I added crowded sound effects and adjusted the volume for different scenes to blend it with the background music. At the end, I applied snow VFX to match with the last snowing scene to the ending logo part. I was a beginner when I was editing this video, and it is a memorable experience for me. I learned a lot of editing techniques from editing this video. I learned how to match the clips with the music video seamlessly, choose suitable footage for highlight videos and combine non-diegetic sounds with the clips.

                    <h3>Analysis #2</h3>
                    <p> This is a stop motion project from IAT 313. I was in charge of filming and editing the video, and I used Premiere Pro to edit the short film. At first, we were brainstorming on the concept we wanted to focus on. SInce the projectâ€™s date is in the month of Halloween, we think that it would be a good idea to film a Halloween related film, therefore, we came up with this film. It is about a skeleton entering an audition to become a superstar. My partner and I made the background and props and we filmed for 3 days. It was a tough time because we had to take a lot of pictures and make it into a video. During the editing process, some of the images are too dark, and I colour graded the images to make the film more lively. I combined the film and looked for the sound effect for the characters. It took me a while to find the sound effects because it is hard to find an effect that is related with a figurine. Although the film is not long, it teaches me how to deliver the film message to the audience within a short amount of time. Also, it teaches me how to edit still images using different fps.
