                    <h3>Bio</h3>
                    <p>Hi, I am Clayton Cheung, and I am a third year IAT student at SFU. I am interested in video editing and UX design. I have learned editing for two years, and I would like to create videos that are related to media and technology. I have a minimalist stylistic approach on designing and editing, therefore, I created a black and white theme website to match with my aesthetic. My main focus is video editing, and I enjoy the moment to create works professionally. Currently exploring different styles of film making to expand my skill. This portfolio is my first step to showcase my work to the audiences.

                    <h3>Analysis #1</h3>
                    <p> This is a highlight reel of the production company I am working in. The highlight reel recaps what the company did in 2018. I was in charge of editing this video, and I used Final Cut Pro X to complete this project. In this project, I selected the clips from various completed projects, such as wedding highlights, music videos, and our competition film. In the beginning, I have to select the b-rolls that are suitable for the intro scene. Then, I picked some scenes that are shooting in different shot sizes. After I combine all the clips, I have to add Luts to all the videos to make it more appealing. I also add some sound effects to make the scene more natural. At 20 seconds, and 50 seconds I added crowded sound effects and adjusted the volume for different scenes to blend it with the background music. In the end, I applied snow VFX to match with the last snowing scene to the end scene. I was a beginner when I was editing this video, and it is a memorable experience for me. I learned a lot of editing techniques from editing this video. I learned how to match the clips with the music video seamlessly, choose suitable footage for highlight videos, and combine non-diegetic sounds with the clips.

                    <h3>Analysis #2</h3>
                    <p> This is a stop motion project from IAT 313. I was in charge of filming and editing the video, and I used Premiere Pro to edit the short film. At first, we were brainstorming on the concept we wanted to focus on. Since the project’s date is in the month of Halloween, we think that it would be a good idea to film a Halloween related film, therefore, we came up with this film. It is about a skeleton entering an audition to become a superstar. My partner and I made the background and props and we filmed for 3 days. It was a tough time because we had to take a lot of pictures and make them into a video. During the editing process, some of the images are too dark, and I colour graded the images to make the film more lively. I combined the film and looked for the sound effect for the characters. It took me a while to find the sound effects because it is hard to find an effect that is related to a figurine. Although the film is not long, it teaches me how to deliver the film message to the audience within a short amount of time. Also, it teaches me how to edit still images using different fps.

                    <p>Hi, I am Clayton Cheung, and I am a third year IAT student at SFU. I am interested in video editing and UX design. I have learned editing for two years, and I would like to create videos that are related to media and technology. I have a minimalist stylistic approach on designing and editing, therefore, I created a black and white theme website to match with my aesthetic. My main focus is video editing, and I enjoy the moment to create works professionally. Currently exploring different styles of film making to expand my skill. This portfolio is my first step to showcase my work to the audiences. </p>
